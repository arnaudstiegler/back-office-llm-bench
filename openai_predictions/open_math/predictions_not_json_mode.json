Using Fermat's Little Theorem, $3^6\\equiv 1\\pmod{9}$, so $3^{2n}\\equiv 3^{2n \\bmod 6}\\pmod{9}$.\nSince we are working modulo $9$ and $n$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $n\\bmod 6$ are $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, or $0$. We can simplify this to $n\\bmod 6 \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n\nNow, let's compute the remainders when $3^{2n} + 4$ is divided by $9$ for these cases:\n- When $n\\bmod 6 = 1$, $3^{2n} + 4 \\equiv 3^2 + 4 = 13\\equiv 4\\pmod{9}$\n- When $n\\bmod 6 = 2$, $3^{2n} + 4 \\equiv 3^4 + 4 \\equiv 81 + 4 \\equiv 4\\pmod{9}$\n- When $n\\bmod 6 = 3$, $3^{2n} + 4 \\equiv 3^6 + 4 \\equiv 1 + 4 \\equiv 5\\pmod{9}$\n- When $n\\bmod 6 = 4$, $3^{2n} + 4 \\equiv 3^8 + 4 \\equiv 6561 + 4 \\equiv 4\\pmod{9}$\n- When $n\\bmod 6 = 5$, $3^{2n} + 4 \\equiv 3^{10} + 4 \\equiv 19683 + 4 \\equiv 6\\pmod{9}$\n\nTherefore, the remainders of $a$ when divided by $9$ are $5$, $4$, $6$, $4$, and $5$ respectively for the cases $n\\bmod 6 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$. \n\nBased on these cases, there is a pattern: the remainders cycle in the order $5, 4, 6, 4, 5$ as $n$ varies modulo $6$. \n\nFor any positive integer $n$, the corresponding remainder when $a$ is divided by $9$ is the remainder from the cycle $5, 4, 6, 4, 5$ at the position $n\\bmod 6$, which means the remainders follow the sequence $5, 4, 6, 4, 5, 5, 4, 6, 4, 5, \\ldots$\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is that the remainder of $a$ when divided by $9$ is determined by the cycle $5, 4, 6, 4, 5$ at the position $n\\bmod 6$.\n\nThe answer in the requested JSON format is:  \n{'answer': '5'}", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1709734678, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_2b778c6b35", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 811, "prompt_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 1032}}, {"id": "chatcmpl-8zmNypAkdvu3PMBdYH31y74hOiq0n", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "To find the sum of the first 102 counting numbers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\nSum = n * (n + 1) / 2\n\nwhere n is the number of terms.\n\nFor n = 102:\nSum = 102 * (102 + 1) / 2\nSum = 102 * 103 / 2\nSum = 5253\n\nNow, to find the remainder when this sum is divided by 5250:\nRemainder = 5253 % 5250\nRemainder = 3\n\nThe remainder when the sum of the first 102 counting numbers is divided by 5250 is 3.\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"3\"\n}", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1709734694, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_2b778c6b35", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 356}}, {"id": "chatcmpl-8zmO2EVqBAZaXTrRgU8HAAi90jCG5", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "To evaluate $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{2}\\,\\right\\rceil+\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{22}\\,\\right\\rceil+\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{222}\\,\\right\\rceil$, we first calculate the square roots:\n\n- $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$\n- $\\sqrt{22} \\approx 4.690$\n- $\\sqrt{222} \\approx 14.899$\n\nThen, we round up to the nearest integer:\n\n- $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{2}\\,\\right\\rceil = 2$\n- $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{22}\\,\\right\\rceil = 5$\n- $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{222}\\,\\right\\rceil = 15$\n\nFinally, we add them up:\n\n$2 + 5 + 15 = 22$\n\nTherefore, $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{2}\\,\\right\\rceil+\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{22}\\,\\right\\rceil+\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{222}\\,\\right\\rceil = 22$.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"22\"\n}", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1709734698, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_2b778c6b35", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 235, "prompt_tokens": 218, "total_tokens": 453}}, {"id": "chatcmpl-8zmO6ewLPimOdSgEGYZGtZ2mkNFoS", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "First, let's calculate the total distances both Jesse and Mia need to cover:\n\nJesse:\n- Day 1 distance: (2/3) mile\n- Day 2 distance: (2/3) mile\n- Day 3 distance: (2/3) mile\n- Day 4 distance: 10 miles\nTotal distance covered by Jesse in the first 4 days = (2/3 + 2/3 + 2/3 + 10) miles = 10.67 miles\n\nMia:\n- Day 1 to Day 4 total distance: 4 days * 3 miles/day = 12 miles\n\nRemaining distance for both of them to cover over the final 3 days = Total distance - Distance covered in the first 4 days\nRemaining distance = 30 miles - 12 miles = 18 miles\n\nJesse and Mia need to cover a total of 18 miles over the final 3 days.
